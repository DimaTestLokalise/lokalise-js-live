# Introduction

Lokalise LiveJS is a JavaScript plugin that allows your translators edit your website texts and translations right in place. All the changes are being automatically synchronized with Lokalise, however you still need to take care of updating your local translation files as the changes are made. 

This plugin does not download or fetch any translations from Lokalise, it's only purpose is to allow in-context editing and sync back to Lokalise.
